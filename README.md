# Tetranucleotide-Frequency
# tetra.py allows for calculating the tetranucleotide frequency (TNF) of gene sequences and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) on the resulting TNF for all contigs.
# Files ending in ".fasta" are sample files of DNA contigs that can be used within the program tetra.py
